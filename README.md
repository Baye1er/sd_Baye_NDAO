# sd_Baye_NDAO
The aim of this project is to write a Python code which allows an user to retrieve a file in a CSV, JSON, YAML or XML.
Check up if the file is one the listed above.
Convert all of them in a Python object.
And once it is done, according to the type of file choosed by the user(CSV, JSON, YAML or XML), we should display its 
correponding files to the remaining types of file. 
Eg if the user choose an CSV, once it is transformed to a Python type (dictionnary), we have to moreover convert it in a JSON,YAML and XML and display all of them.
